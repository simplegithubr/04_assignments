
# Problem Statement
# Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

# Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Sophia (the autograder expects the returned name to be Sophia):

# Howdy Sophia ! ðŸ¤ 

#solution
def get_name():
   return "Sophia"  
def main():
   name = get_name()
   print(f"Howdy {name} ! ðŸ¤ ")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
