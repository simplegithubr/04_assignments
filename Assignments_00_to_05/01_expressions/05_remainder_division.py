
# Problem Statement
# Ask the user for two numbers, one at a time, and then print the result of dividing the first number by the second and also the remainder of the division.

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

# Please enter an integer to be divided: 5

# Please enter an integer to divide by: 3

# The result of this division is 1 with a remainder of 2

# Solution
def main():
    dividend: int = int(input("Please enter an integer to be divided: "))
    divisor: int = int(input("Please enter an integer to divide by: "))
    quotient: int = dividend // divisor
    remainder: int = dividend % divisor
    print("The result of this division is", quotient, "with a remainder of", remainder)
