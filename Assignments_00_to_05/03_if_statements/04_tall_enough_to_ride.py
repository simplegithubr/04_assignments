# Problem Statement
# Write a program which asks the user how tall they are and prints whether or not they're taller than a pre-specified minimum height.

# In amusement parks (ah, the good old pre-pandemic days...), rollercoasters frequently have minimum height requirements for safety reasons. Assume for now that the minimum height is 50 of whatever height unit you'd like

# Here's two sample runs (user input is in bold italics):

# How tall are you? 100

# You're tall enough to ride!

# How tall are you? 10

# You're not tall enough to ride, but maybe next year!

# (For an extra challenge, write code which will repeatedly ask a user how tall they are and tell them whether or not they're tall enough to ride, until the user doesn't enter a height at all, in which case the program stops. Curious about how to do this? See the function tall_enough_extension() in the solution code!)

#Solution

MINUM_HEIGHT : int = 50
def main():
    hight: int = int(input("How tall are you? "))
    if hight >= MINUM_HEIGHT:
        print("You're tall enough to ride!")
    else:
        print("You're not tall enough to ride, but maybe next year!")
